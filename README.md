# igf-transcript-extractor
This is a quick and dirty python3 script that depends on ``wget`` downloads all the available transcripts from the IGF 2019. 

It would have been better to use the request lib. But sadly the website blocks requests made from a python script and changing the headers I ran into a few bugs. Fell free to make a pull request to make this script more inclusive.

Also there is a version from the last day in the repo.

# igf-transcript-extractor
This is a quick and dirty python3 script that depends on ``wget`` downloads all the available transcripts from the IGF 2019. 

It would be better to use the python request lib. But sadly the website blocks requests made from a python script and trying changing the headers I ran into a few bugs. Fell free to make a pull request to make this script more inclusive.

Also it please share any kind of text analysis or usage of the gatherd transcripts, I am interested what they can be used for.
